The krb5.patch includes changes based on MITKerberos v1.8.3 at http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/dist/index.html

Users should follow the online instruction guides for Kerberos installation.

Use the krb5admin tools provided in their source code to set up the Kerberos database accordingly.


Minisip:
========

The minisip.patch includes changes based on Minisip at http://www.minisip.org/

building_minisip.html provides additional instructions to get the the Minisip libraries installed properly.

KM1 & KM2:
==========

Source code for the gcks and clients are located in kmtools/ sclient1 and gcks1 corresponds to KM1 model

and sclient2 and gcks2 corresponds to KM2 model. To setup the KM tools, perform the following code

make all
make install

This must be done after Krb5 and Minisip libraries are properly installed.
